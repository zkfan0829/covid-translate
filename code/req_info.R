# In most cases, these assignments should not need to be changed.
# But if for some reason you have altered the layout of the request
# package, you will need to edit these accordingly:
#
#  * code_dir = location of code for request
#  * spec_dir = location of data files needed to execute the request
#  * local_dir = location to which intermediate results may be saved
#    for local inspection
#  * result_dir = location to which results to be returned to the DCC
#    will be written
#
# N.B.  If you change code_dir, you must either source this file
# prior to util.R (the usual case), or edit util.R and driver.R to
# reflect the change.
